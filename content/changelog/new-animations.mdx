Finally tackling those finishing touches before launch! Added some tasteful animations to bring a bit more life to the site without going overboard.

The profile picture now eases in smoothly, text elements fade up with a slight delay, and my favorite part - the highlighted photos now fan out in sequence when they appear.
Tried to hit that sweet spot between "barely noticeable" and "unnecessarily flashy." I think it adds just the right amount of polish without distracting from the content.
